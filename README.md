This is a clone of the game galaxy empire.
open Client.html, it should connect to ws://nickasnow.tk:1233, if the game doesnt seem to work, the server is probably not on.
it is not fully functional in its current state.
the images packaged with this are not mine, they are from the game 'Galaxy Empire', I will attempt to make my own icons at some point.

this thing is a huge mess. It's riddled with different naming conventions, global variables, and verbose code. I am not as fluent in javascript as i am in C, there's a lot I don't know. I plan on completly rewriting this, but I need to learn how to write the server in a way that's easy to maintain
